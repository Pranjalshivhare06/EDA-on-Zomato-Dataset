# EDA-on-Zomato-Dataset
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to extract meaningful insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and customer preferences. The goal was to analyze trends, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights for improving customer experience and business strategies.
