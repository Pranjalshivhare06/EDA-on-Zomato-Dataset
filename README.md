# EDA-on-Zomato-Dataset
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to extract meaningful insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and customer preferences. The goal was to analyze trends, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights for improving customer experience and business strategies.

I have uploaded the python code file as well as the HTML file. If you want to check the code and the results, you can download html file directly and can go throught it. 
Feel free to reach out for any any query or suggestion.
